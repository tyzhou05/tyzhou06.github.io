  Hi! I'm Tony (he/him), originally from Campbell, CA, but soon to be a freshman at the University of Washington, Seattle this fall. As I'm not quite too sure about what exactly I want to study (aero/astro? ece? hcde? cs?!) or really even end up doing in life yet, I thought it'd be a good idea to take the time this summer to revamp my personal website, so here I am!
</p>

<p>
  Previously, I was lucky enough to work on some <a href = "https://github.com/tyzhou05/website/blob/master/ASGSR%202021.pdf">cool projects</a> that were sent to the ISS, intern at <a href = "https://nasa.gov/ames"> NASA</a>, and spend many weekends in air-conditioned hotel rooms trying (and failing) to beat kids half my age in <a href = "https://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?16147444"> chess tournaments</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Currently this summer, I like to try new cafés around San José, walk my 9-month-old puppy, cook pastas, climb plastic rocks (will conquer those tricky purple v4s one day), curate my extensive-yet-basic Spotify k-pop playlists, collect various articles of clothing with embroidered symbols, and try to do many more things that don't alliterate with c.

  Feel free to use the tabs around to learn more about me, and please don't hesitate to reach out — I'm always down to chat! One day if I'm not feeling lazy I'll start that blog on the top right.
