  Hi! I'm Tony (he/him), from Campbell, CA, but soon to be an engineering undeclared (ENGRUD) freshman at the University of Washington, Seattle this fall. As I'm not quite too sure about what exactly I want to study (aero/astro? hcde? ece? cs?!) or really even end up doing in life yet, I thought it'd be a good idea to take the time this summer to revamp my personal website, so here I am!
</p>

  Previously in high school, I worked on some <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/vchs_iss/">cool projects</a> that were sent to the ISS, was lucky enough to intern at <a href = "https://nasa.gov/ames"> NASA</a>, and spent many weekends in air-conditioned hotel rooms trying (and failing) to beat kids half my age in <a href = "https://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?16147444"> chess tournaments</a>.
</p>

  Currently this summer, I like to try new cafés around San Jose, walk my 9-month-old puppy, cook pastas, climb plastic rocks, curate my extensive-yet-basic Spotify k-pop playlists, collect various articles of clothing with embroidered symbols, and try to do many more things that don't alliterate with c.

  Feel free to use the tabs around to learn more about me, and please don't hesitate to reach out — I'm always down to chat! And maybe one day if I'm not feeling lazy I'll start that blog on the top right.
