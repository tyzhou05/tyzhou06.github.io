  Hi! I'm Tony (he/him), currently an undergraduate studying computer science at the  <a href = "https://cs.washington.edu/"> <img src="/assets/img/uw.png" width="16px"> University of Washington</a>, but originally from sunny San Jose, California. I'm interested in human-comptuter interaction, augmented reality, and social computing.
</p>

<p>
  At UW, I'm a research assistant at the <img src="/assets/img/makeability.png" width="18px"> <a href = "https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/">Makeability Lab</a>, where I'm developing a holographic running assistant with the Apple Vision Pro. I'm also building a driverless racecar with <img src="/assets/img/uwfsae.png" width="20px"> <a href = "https://www.uwformulamotorsports.com/">UW Formula</a>, and work part-time at my school's very own <a href = "https://www.washington.edu/ima/uwild/climb-with-rec/climbing-spaces/crags-climbing-center/"> climbing gym</a>. This summer, I'm interning at <a href = "https://ixl.com"> <img src="/assets/img/ixl.png" width="28px"> Learning</a>, where I'm working on back-end infrastructure and analytics to support online learning for the largest Edtech company in the United States. I've previously also worked at <img src="/assets/img/nasa.png" width="18px"> NASA Ames and Stanford Med.

<p>
  In my free time, I like to try new coffee shops in the U-District, climb plastic rocks at Seattle Bouldering Project, cook pastas, curate my Spotify playlists, and collect bucket hats with embroidered symbols.
