  Hi! I'm Tony (he/him), currently an undergraduate student at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington, but originally from sunny San Jose, California. I'm broadly interested in human-computer interaction research, accessibility, and augmented/virtual reality.
</p>

<p>
  At UW, I'm a research assistant at the <a href = "https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/">Makeability Lab</a>, developing a holographic running assistant with the Apple Vision Pro. I'm also building a driverless racecar with <a href = "https://www.uwformulamotorsports.com/">UW Formula</a>, work part-time at my school's very own <a href = "https://www.washington.edu/ima/uwild/climb-with-rec/climbing-spaces/crags-climbing-center/"> climbing gym</a>, and have lots of fun with the <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/csauw/"> UW Chinese Student Association</a>.
</p>

<!--<p>
  Previously, I was lucky enough to work on some <a href = "https://github.com/tyzhou05/website/blob/master/ASGSR%202021.pdf">cool projects</a> that were sent to the ISS, intern at <a href = "https://nasa.gov/ames"> NASA</a>, and spend many weekends in air-conditioned hotel rooms trying (and failing) to beat kids half my age in <a href = "https://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?16147444"> chess tournaments</a>.

<p>
  In my free time, I like to try new coffee shops in the U-District, climb plastic rocks at Seattle Bouldering Project, cook pastas, curate my Spotify playlists, collect bucket hats with embroidered symbols, and try to do many more things that don't alliterate with c.

  Feel free to use the tabs around to learn more about me, and please don't hesitate to reach out â€” I'm always down to chat! One day if I'm not feeling lazy I'll start that blog on the top right.
