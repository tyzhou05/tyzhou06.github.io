  Hi! I'm Tony (he/him), originally from San Jose, CA, but soon to be a freshman at the University of Washington this fall. As I'm not quite too sure about what exactly I want to study or end up doing in life yet, I thought it'd be a good idea to take the time this summer to revamp my personal website, so here I am! In my free time, I like playing chess, cooking, climbing, and many more things that don't alliterate with c.
