  Hi! I'm Tony (he/him), currently an undergraduate student studying <a href = "https://cs.washington.edu/">computer science</a> at the University of Washington, but originally from sunny San Jose, California. I'm broadly interested in human-computer interaction and accessibility research.
</p>

<p>
  At UW, I'm a research assistant at the <a href = "https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/">Makeability Lab</a>, where I'm developing a holographic running assistant with the Apple Vision Pro. I'm also building a driverless racecar with <a href = "https://www.uwformulamotorsports.com/">UW Formula</a>, work part-time at my school's very own <a href = "https://www.washington.edu/ima/uwild/climb-with-rec/climbing-spaces/crags-climbing-center/"> climbing gym</a>, and host cultural events with the <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/csauw/"> UW Chinese Student Association</a>.
</p>

<p>
  In my free time, I like to try new coffee shops in the U-District, climb plastic rocks at Seattle Bouldering Project, cook pastas, curate my Spotify playlists, collect bucket hats with embroidered symbols, and try to do many more things that don't alliterate with c.

  Feel free to use the tabs around to learn more about me, and please don't hesitate to reach out â€” I'm always down to chat! One day, whenever I find the time to, I'll start that blog on the top right.
