  Hi! I'm Tony (he/him), from San Jose, CA, but soon to be an engineering undeclared (ENGRUD) freshman at the University of Washington, Seattle this fall. As I'm not quite too sure about what exactly I want to study or end up doing in life yet, I thought it'd be a good idea to take the time this summer to revamp my personal website, so here I am!

  Previously, I worked on some cool projects that were sent to the ISS, was lucky enough to intern at <a href = "https://nasa.gov/ames"> NASA</a>, and spent many weekends in air-conditioned hotel rooms trying to beat kids half my age in chess tournaments.

  Currently, I brew coffee, cook pastas, walk my 9-month-old puppy, climb plastic rocks, curate my extensive-yet-basic Spotify k-pop playlists, collect various clothing with embroidered symbols, and try to do many more things that don't alliterate with c.
