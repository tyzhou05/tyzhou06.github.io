  Hi! I'm Tony, a soon-to-be freshman at the University of Washington, Seattle, but not quite sure about what I want to study yet. I thought I'd take the time this summer to revamp my personal website, so here I am! In my free time, I like playing chess, cooking, climbing, and many more things that don't alliterate with c. Feel free to use the tabs around to learn more about me and don't hesitate to reach out -- I'm always down for a chat! :)

  This website was made with Jekyll using Elliot Vincent's Bay template. You can find the source code and the instructions on <a href="https://github.com/eliottvincent/bay">GitHub</a>.
