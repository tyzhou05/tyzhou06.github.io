<p>
  Hi! I'm Tony (he/him), a student at the University of Washington studying Computer Science.
</p>

<p>
  Previously, I was lucky enough to work on some <a href = "https://github.com/tyzhou05/website/blob/master/ASGSR%202021.pdf">cool projects</a> that were sent to the ISS, intern at <a href = "https://nasa.gov/ames"> NASA</a>, and spend many weekends in air-conditioned hotel rooms trying (and failing) to beat kids half my age in <a href = "https://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?16147444"> chess tournaments</a>.
</p>

<p>
  At UW, I'm involved with Formula Motorsports, and the chess club. 
</p>

<p>
  In my free time, I like to try new cafés around San José, walk my 9-month-old puppy, cook pastas, climb plastic rocks (will conquer those tricky purple v4s one day), curate my extensive-yet-basic Spotify playlists spanning every artist from Adele to Zedd, collect various bucket hats with embroidered symbols, and try to do many more things that don't alliterate with c. 
</p>

<p>
  Feel free to use the tabs around to learn more about me, and please don't hesitate to reach out — I'm always down to chat! One day if I'm not feeling lazy I'll start that blog on the top right.
</p>
