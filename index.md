  Hi! I'm Tony, from San Jose, CA, but soon to be a freshman at the University of Washington, Seattle. As I'm not  quite sure what I want to study yet, I thought I'd take the time this summer to revamp my personal website and document all my interests, so here I am! In my free time, I like playing chess, cooking, climbing, and many more things that don't alliterate with c.
