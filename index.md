  Hi! I'm Tony (he/him), currently a student at the University of Washington studying computer science, but originally from sunny San Jose, CA.
</p>

<p>
  At UW, I'm a research assistant at the <a href = "https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/">Makeability Lab</a>, developing an AR running assistant with the Apple Vision Pro. I'm also involved with the <a href = "https://www.uwformulamotorsports.com/">UW Formula Motorsports</a> team, the <a href = "https://www.washington.edu/ima/uwild/climb-with-rec/climbing-spaces/crags-climbing-center/"> Crags Climbing Center</a> at the IMA, and the <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/csauw/"> Chinese Student Association</a>.
</p>

<!--<p>
  Previously, I was lucky enough to work on some <a href = "https://github.com/tyzhou05/website/blob/master/ASGSR%202021.pdf">cool projects</a> that were sent to the ISS, intern at <a href = "https://nasa.gov/ames"> NASA</a>, and spend many weekends in air-conditioned hotel rooms trying (and failing) to beat kids half my age in <a href = "https://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?16147444"> chess tournaments</a>.

<p>
  In my free time, I like to try new coffee shops around Seattle, climb plastic rocks at Seattle Bouldering Project, cook pastas, curate my Spotify playlists, collect bucket hats with embroidered symbols, and try to do many more things that don't alliterate with c. 
</p>

  Feel free to use the tabs around to learn more about me, and please don't hesitate to reach out â€” I'm always down to chat! One day if I'm not feeling lazy I'll start that blog on the top right.
