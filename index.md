  Hi! I'm Tony (he/him), currently an undergraduate student studying <a href = "https://cs.washington.edu/">computer science</a> at the University of Washington, but originally from sunny San Jose, California.
</p>

<p>
  At UW, I'm a research assistant at the <a href = "https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/">Makeability Lab</a>, where I'm developing a holographic running assistant with the Apple Vision Pro. I'm also building a driverless racecar with <a href = "https://www.uwformulamotorsports.com/">UW Formula</a>, and work part-time at my school's very own <a href = "https://www.washington.edu/ima/uwild/climb-with-rec/climbing-spaces/crags-climbing-center/"> climbing gym</a>. This summer, I'm working at 
  <a href = "https://ixl.com"> IXL Learning</a>, where I'm working on back-end infrastructure to support online learning 
  for the largest EdTech company in the United States.
</p>

<p>
  In my free time, I like to try new coffee shops in the U-District, climb plastic rocks at Seattle Bouldering Project, cook pastas, curate my Spotify playlists, and collect bucket hats with embroidered symbols.
</p>

<p>
  Feel free to use the tabs around to learn more about me, and please don't hesitate to reach out â€” I'm always down to chat! One day, whenever I find the time to, I'll start that blog on the top right.
